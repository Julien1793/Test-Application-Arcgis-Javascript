# Test-Application-Arcgis-Javascript


This web map application is made without framework. It's just a test to try the features of arcgis API for Javascript version 4.+
This application can't be hosted because it uses internal Vinci autoroutes urls. The urls have been remove from the code.

This application include  :
- a call for services hosted on portal and arcgis server;
- a call for custom API hosted on arcgis server;
- dynamic load of WFS stream from IGN (parcelle cadastrales);
- dynamic edit layer from popup;
- a custom widget that can make localisation along the highways.

You can see a demo just below :
